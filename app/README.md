# Particle Tinker app for Android

[Install the Tinker app on your Android device from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app)

Get connected and start building your Internet of Things project right away with Particle, the companion app to the Photon, a tiny but powerful Wi-Fi development board from the team at Particle. Your Photon and this app are all you need to get started with your project or prototype; the kit comes pre-loaded with our firmware libraries and is connected to the cloud out of the box.
Download Particle to easily connect your Photon to a Wi-Fi network in a few simple steps. No coding required. The app will take you through the entire set-up process step by step until the LED on your board is breathing cyan - indicating it's connected and ready to be programmed!
